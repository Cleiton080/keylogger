# Keylogger

## What's keylogging?

> "___Keylogging___ is the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly, so that person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored" by _Wikipedia definition_.

## Starting

- Make sure your computer has the _python_ and _pip_ installed.
- Install the _pynput_ libary using the pip command.
- Now you can run the python script named _keylogger_
- As an optional step, you can install the _pyinstaller_ to build an .exe executabel

## Runing

    When you run the python script or the .exe and write something, you'll notice that will be created a text file named keylogger.txt on root folder. Inside this file, you'll see all the keys pressed by the user.

## Warning
    This code hasn't any intention to be used of wrong way, I just thought it might be good to practice my programming skills and share on my public repository on github.
